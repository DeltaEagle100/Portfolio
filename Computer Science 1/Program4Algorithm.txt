I need my program to ask the user for a password. If the password
is not strong enough, it needs to print an error and ask the user
for another password and update an error counting variable by 1.
That variable starts at 0. If it reaches 4 and the user has not
yet entered an acceptable password, it prints an error that the
user has run out of tries; else, if the user enters a password
that meets all security standards at any point, it prints a
message saying that the password is acceptable.
